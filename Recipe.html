    <h1 style="text-align: center  ;color:brown">Gulab Jamun Recipe</h1>
    <p style="color:coral"><b>Ingredients </b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1cup milk powder</li>
        <li>6tbsp all purpose flour or  maida ( 1/4)</li>
        <li>2 tsp ghee  or oil</li>
        <li>1 tbsp milk curd or yogurt</li>
        <li> Baking Soda</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Green Cardomom</li>   
        <li>Rose water</li>   

    </ul>


    <p style="color:coral"><b>Steps </b></div>
    <ol>
        <li>Take 1½ cups sugar, 3-4 green cardamoms (or 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder) and 
            8-10 saffron strands in a deep pan.</li><br>
            <br><li>Add 2½ cups water and bring mixture to boil over high flame. When it comes to rolling boil, reduce flame to medium and cook until sugar syrup is little sticky, it will take around 10-12 minutes. Stir occasionally in between. Turn off the flame. Sugar syrup is ready. After deep frying jamuns in later step, heat the sugar syrup for 4-5 minutes</li>
            <br> <li>Prepare 1 cup mawa by following the recipe given above or use readymade mawa. Crumble it using hand or grate it using a grater. Add 1/8 teaspoon baking soda and 1/2 cup sifted maida.</li>
            <br> <li>Mix them gently using a spoon.</li>
            <br> <li> As you can see, the flour is easily mixed with mawa because of moisture in mawa.</li>
            <br> <li>Knead all of them together until smooth dough is prepared. If required add a few teaspoons of milk to knead a smooth and soft dough (add one teaspoon milk at a time until smooth consistency of dough is achieved, do not add large amount in single go).</li>
            <br> <li>Divide dough into 16-18 equal parts, grease hands with ghee and make smooth surfaced balls from it. Make sure that there is no crack on the surface of balls because it will make jamuns to crack open while deep frying. If you are not able to form crack-less balls, then you need to make dough bit softer. To do this, add milk in dough, knead it again and roll the balls again. Do not make very large balls because they will increase in size after deep frying and soaking in syrup.</li>
            <br><li>Heat ghee or oil (or 1/2 ghee and 1/2 oil) in a pan over medium flame. When ghee is medium hot, add a pinch of dough in hot ghee and if it comes upward immediately without changing it’s color, ghee is ready. If it turns brown immediately, ghee is too hot. If it doesn’t come upward, ghee is cold. Add prepared dough balls (4-6 at a time or depending on the size of a pan) and deep-fry them over low to medium flame. As you can see they will turn light golden and increase in size after a minute. If the jamuns turn dark brown immediately then the temperature of ghee is too hot, pour some cold ghee in to ghee to reduce the temperature.</li>   
            <br> <li>After 3-4 minutes, they will turn light golden brown.</li>  
            <br><li>Deep fry them until they turn golden brown, it will take around 6-7 minutes. Cooking them evenly is the key to soft and textured gulab jamuns, increase or decrease flame intensity to keep the temperature of ghee even while frying them.</li> 
            <br><li>Drain and transfer them over kitchen napkin and let them cool for 5-minutes. As you can see, the balls are increased in size after deep frying. Do not add them directly into warm sugar syrup.</li>
            <br><li>Add fried balls into warm sugar syrup (not hot syrup). If you add them into hot syrup, they will shrink in size.</li>
            <br><li>Soak them for at least 1-2 hours before serving. As you can see in the picture, the jammuns are increased to almost double in size. Gulab jamuns are ready for serving. Serve them warm or chilled.</li>
